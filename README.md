# BBG_Capstone: Anomaly Detection in Stock Returns

## Project Overview
Detecting anomalies in large datasets is a challenging problem with numerous applications in finance. If a stock is flagged as having anomalous returns, it could simply be due to recent news, or it could indicate hidden risks that need to be considered. Machine learning models are traditionally effective at finding patterns by aggregating weak signals over large datasets, making them well-suited for anomaly detection in stock returns.

## Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. **Model Development:** Build and evaluate anomaly detection models of increasing complexity to detect anomalies in stock returns.
2. **Qualitative Analysis:** Apply these models to analyze the types of anomalies they detect and those they miss.
3. **Visualization Interface:** Develop an interactive and compelling interface to visualize model outputs for enhanced interpretability and decision-making.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
